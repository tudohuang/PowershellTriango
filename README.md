To use "PowershellTriangle", you will need either a Windows system for PowerShell or a Unix-like system (e.g., Ubuntu) for bash.

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later for running the PowerShell script.
- Bash shell for running the Ubuntu script.

### Running the Script
#### PowerShell
1. Open PowerShell on your Windows machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `PowershellTriangle.ps1` script.
3. Run the script with the command:
   ```powershell

   ```bash
   ./UbuntuTriangle.sh
   ```
5. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.
